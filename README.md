# Supermarket Checkout Simulation

## Project Overview
This project simulates a **supermarket checkout system** using Python. It models customer behavior at **self-checkout and regular lanes**, optimizing queue management and processing efficiency. The simulation dynamically assigns customers to the appropriate lanes based on their shopping basket size and calculates the time taken for each checkout process.

## Features
- Two types of checkout lanes: **Regular Checkout** (for larger baskets) and **Self-Checkout** (for smaller baskets)
- Randomized customer behavior, including basket size and checkout lane assignment
- Dynamic queue management to optimize lane efficiency
- Calculation of processing time based on basket size and checkout speed
- Lottery system where some customers win rewards
- Real-time timestamps to monitor the simulation process

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for simulation and logic implementation
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** for structured code design
- **Random module** for customer behavior simulation
- **Time module** for execution timing and real-time updates

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SupermarketCheckoutSim.git
   cd SupermarketCheckoutSim
   ```
2. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python supermarket_simulation.py
   ```
3. Observe the **checkout process, queue management, and lottery system** in action.

## Insights Gained
- Understanding of **queue management systems** in retail
- Application of **object-oriented programming** principles
- Simulating **real-world customer flow** using Python
- Performance analysis of **self-checkout vs. regular lanes**

## Future Improvements
- Implement **machine learning** to predict optimal lane assignments
- Enhance **visualization** with real-time queue tracking
- Add a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for better interaction
